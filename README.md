Automated PLC-based cement mixing system that precisely controls the flow, mixing, and transfer of ingredients to ensure consistent batch quality. The system operates as follows:

1. Ingredient A Dispensing: Valve A is opened to add Ingredient A to the tank. Flow Meter A tracks the volume, emitting a pulse for each gallon. Valve A remains open until 200 gallons are dispensed.


2. Ingredient B Dispensing: Once Ingredient A is added, Valve B is opened to dispense Ingredient B. Flow Meter B tracks the volume, emitting pulses for each gallon, until 200 gallons are dispensed.


3. Mixing Process: After both ingredients are added, the mixer motor is activated, operating for 10 seconds to ensure a homogeneous mix.


4. Transfer to Finishing Tank: After mixing, Valve C opens to release the mixed batch into the finishing tank.


5. Low-Level Detection: The low-level sensor monitors the tank. When the tank is empty, it signals to close Valve C and initiate a new cycle.



This project demonstrates the use of sensors, flow meters, and actuators for precise control of industrial mixing processes, ensuring accurate ingredient measurement, thorough mixing, and efficient batch transfer for consistent productionÂ quality.
